                        <h1>The Oprah Magazine</h1>
                        <h2>February 2012</h2>
                        <p>Dana Tanamachi brought fresh, imaginative flair to O, The Oprah Magazine's February issue, breaking away from the usual Valentine's Day motifs. Given free rein to "Express yourself," Tanamachi filled the cover with her own inspired doodles, resulting in a standout design. Her work was so well-received that she was invited to create additional artwork for the magazine's “You In Six Words” feature, guiding readers to craft their own life mantras. Tanamachi’s presence at the photoshoot allowed her to make real-time adjustments, and her process was later spotlighted in the magazine’s “Behind the Scenes” column.</p>
